# Patient BMI Health Metrics System

This project demonstrates a simple Python program that calculates a patient's Body Mass Index (BMI), classifies the BMI category, assesses health risks, and generates a formatted health report.

---

## 📌 Features

The program includes:

### **1. Patient Class**
Defines a patient with the following attributes:
- `name`: Patient's name
- `weight_kg`: Weight in kilograms
- `height_m`: Height in meters
- `bmi`: Calculated Body Mass Index

### **2. BMI Calculation**
The `calculate_bmi()` method computes BMI using:
```
BMI = weight_kg / (height_m ** 2)
```
Includes basic validation to prevent division errors.

### **3. BMI Categorization**
The `get_bmi_category()` method returns categories including:
- Underweight
- Normal weight
- Overweight
- Obese Class I, II, III

### **4. Health Risk Assessment**
The `assess_risk()` method links each BMI category to a health risk explanation.

### **5. Report Generator**
The `display_report()` method prints a structured health report containing:
- Patient details
- BMI value
- BMI category
- Health risk assessment

## 🧪 Example Patients
The `main()` function includes predefined patients:
- Alice Johnson
- Bob Williams
- Charlie Brown

Each patient has their BMI calculated and a report printed automatically.

---

## 📝 User Input Mode
The program also allows users to enter:
- Name
- Weight (kg)
- Height (m)

A new `Patient` object is generated and the report is displayed.

Error handling ensures:
- Only valid numbers are accepted
- Unexpected exceptions are reported safely

---

## ▶️ Running the Program
Run the script using:
```
python3 your_script_name.py
```
The predefined patient reports will appear, followed by a prompt for user input.

## 📂 File Structure Suggestion
```
project/
│── patient_bmi.py
│── README.md
```

---

## ✔️ Requirements
- Python 3.7+

No external libraries are required.

---

## 📘 Notes
This script is ideal for:
- Learning OOP basics
- Demonstrating class methods and encapsulation
- Basic health metric assessment

It can be expanded with features such as:
- Height/weight input validation
- Unit conversion (lb → kg, ft → m)
- GUI or web interface
